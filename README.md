Improper waste segregation and inefficient waste collection processes contribute to environmental pollution and health hazards. Lack of accountability, awareness, and tracking in waste handling results in poor segregation at source and ineffective collection practices

## 🧩 Problem Description

The modern waste management crisis is driven by a critical breakdown in the lifecycle of refuse, characterized by improper source segregation and a profound lack of operational accountability. Currently, the mixing of organic, recyclable, and hazardous materials at the point of generation creates "contaminated waste streams," rendering circular economy efforts virtually impossible and forcing vast amounts of recoverable resources into landfills. This inefficiency is compounded by a "visibility gap," where municipalities rely on static, outdated collection routes without real-time data on bin capacity or truck locations. As of 2026, this lack of tracking has led to severe environmental and health consequences: unsegregated waste in landfills becomes a primary source of methane ($CH_4$)—a potent greenhouse gas—while toxic leachate from unmonitored dump sites poisons local groundwater. This problem is more relevant than ever as rapid urbanization outpaces traditional infrastructure, making it necessary to transition from a "logistics-only" approach to a data-driven, smart management system. By integrating digital tracking, AI-assisted segregation, and community-driven accountability, we can transform waste from a hazardous liability into a manageable, transparent resource, directly contributing to global Net Zero targets and public health safety.

## 💡 Proposed Solution

Sortify
🔹 Approach

Sortify is a smart, community-centric web application designed to improve waste segregation and management at the locality level by actively involving residents, waste collectors, and administrators on a single digital platform. The system is divided into three dedicated interfaces—Resident, Collector, and Admin—each with clearly defined roles to ensure accountability, transparency, and efficiency in waste handling.
The Resident interface focuses on simplicity, engagement, and awareness, making waste segregation an easy and rewarding habit rather than a burden.

🔹 How It Solves the Problem

Improves Segregation at Source
Residents can request waste pickup, report improperly dumped waste using a geo-tagged camera, and track their contributions digitally. This encourages correct segregation at the source and discourages irresponsible disposal.

Creates Accountability & Transparency
Every waste handover and report is logged in the system. Uploaded images act as proof and are sent as real-time notifications to collectors, reducing negligence and ensuring timely action.

Encourages Participation Through Gamification
Residents earn points for proper waste segregation and regular participation. This reward-based system motivates continuous engagement, even appealing to children and families.

Raises Environmental Awareness
Live air pollution indicators and personalized messages educate residents on the real-time environmental impact of waste mismanagement, linking everyday actions to larger consequences.

Streamlines Collection & Monitoring
Visual dashboards display waste collected and disposed, helping administrators analyze trends and improve collection efficiency.
